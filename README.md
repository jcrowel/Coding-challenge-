This coding challenge was created by me using data provided by potential employers. The challenge was to create an ETL pipeline using python.
To complete this challenge, Jupyter Notebook, pgAdmin 4, Protobufs and ZeroMQ were used.
PgAdmin 4 or postgresql was used to store the data provided and generated to query efficiently. Jupyter Notebook was used to perform the queries, identify outliers, clean data, serialize and then stream the data. To serialize the data protobufs was used and to stream the data (in this case data was streamed to another notebook) ZeroMQ was used.

None of the data they provided me is in this, only the code I created.
